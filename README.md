<h2>Context Understanding</h2>
<h3>Problem Formulation</h3>
A Crime is an action or omission which constitutes an offence and is punishable by law. There 
are many sorts of crimes ranging from property crimes, Drug abuse violence, alcohol related 
crimes and much more. One of the most reported crimes is Violent Crimes, which is when a 
certain person threatened, attempted or actually used physical force against another person or 
property.
To commit these crimes, it is said that men in general, commit violent crimes significantly more 
than women. And ranking top 9 for one of the most dangerous countries for Women is India 
said by “Laura Begley Bloom founder of Begley Bloom Media”. 
Violent crimes against women in India have risen from 9.960 in 2019 to 5.297 in 2020, which 
rises each year said The Times of India. This is a concerning factor especially for the female 
gender living in the country. Not feeling safe in your environment can harm someone’s physical 
and mental health. 
For this concerning issue, will there be research done upon seeing if there are factors that have 
influence on the number of violent crimes against women committed in India and if there are any 
factors that can help lower these rates.

<h2>The goal of the project</h2>
<h3>Including scope</h3>
  <p>The C.A.W. (crimes against women) technology is to help predict the amount of crimes cases 
against women in India for the coming years based on previous data of different factors that 
play a role in such crimes. With the help of the technology can it bring awareness to others such 
as the government, help centers, law enforcement and more to help bring and think of solutions 
to the problem instead of ignoring it and acting as if it is normal.
With the help of this technology can it help make living as a woman in India safer and more 
peaceful.</p>
  <p>Obtaining this goal will take a lot of research done on the reasoning to each crime and what 
attributes play a role. Further will data be needed for these factors so that the technology can 
give an accurate prediction.</p>
  <p>To be able to measure the progress of the technology, will the previous data be split into 2 
sections, namely the test and training data. Where the accuracy of the model of the technology 
of working with the test data will show how well the progress of the technology has increased or 
decreased.  </p>
  <p>Achieving this goal of the technology is dependent on outside factors but also factors by the 
makers of the technology. Outside factors that can determine if the goal is achievable is for 
example being able to retrieve and find the data needed for the technology because all data is 
not always accessible and personal factors include how well the data has been prepped and 
how well the model has been created.   </p>
  <p>Therefore, is the goal only fully achievable if these factors have been met. Nonetheless can the 
prediction model still give predictions even if some of these factors are not or fully fulfilled but 
would it effect the performance.   </p>
  <p>Reaching this goal by making accurate predictions of severity of states/union territories based 
on crimes done against women in India and to try and make a safer environment for these 
women/girls is achievable to some degree. This depends on; the resources that can be 
retrieved such as data, the time given to complete this project where not a lot of different 
models, data and different factors can be looked into in depth and lastly if the stakeholders are 
willing to put in the extra work, time, money and effort to make a change. Therefore, is reaching 
this goal achievable to some extent realistically as in being able to create the technology but 
giving accurate results can always be a downfall considering how well the discussed factors 
play a role in developing this technology.  </p>
  <p>The construction of this technology has a given period of time to be completed which is at its 
latest on the 21st of November. With that being said is reaching this goal dependent on the time 
and effort put into building this technology to help predict the severity of a state/union territory 
for women in India and to try and make it not only a safe and healthy environment for these 
women but to bring a gender equality living where it brings benefits in the country such as 
enhancement in economic productivity, improvement in development outcomes for the next 
generation, and lastly to make institutions and policies more representative.   </p>

<h3>System scope </h3>
  <p>The technology will be constructed using a variety of different tools for different purposes.
Extracting the data will be done using CSV files, pdf files put into excel and api’s.
The data will be stored in a CSV, which can be found in this repository labeled data files.
Next, will the model be made in Jupyter Notebook using Python and the help of several 
libraries/packages.  
And lastly, is the project deployed on heroku so that it can be accessible to anyone at the link 
  <a href='https://deployment-crimes-women.herokuapp.com/'>Predicting the region severity for crimes against women</a></p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

  </ul>
  
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
For this project are there a number of different types of stakeholders withholding their own 
purpose concerning this project.
These stakeholders include:

<h4>Women and girls in India</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This stakeholder is the main target the technology is focused on, to help.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Schools in India </h4>
<ul>
  <li>This stakeholder is a helped factor in prediction model. And also, a helped 
benefit for themselves where the less cases done against women, the more tools 
and fichtelites they have for other cases.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hospitals in India</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This stakeholder is a helped factor in prediction model. And also, a helped 
benefit for themselves where the less cases done against women, the more tools 
and facilities they have for other cases.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Law enforcements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This stakeholder is a helped factor in prediction model. This stakeholder involves 
the police forces and law department of a state in India. With more law 
enforcements for a state if that includes more police forces & security cameras 
and better laws to protect women from violent. Does it create a safer and 
peaceful environment to live in for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Help centers for women one stop centers, shelters for women, social workers, therapists</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The stakeholder is concerning where women go after crimes occur to them, with 
the help of this technology can the be more room for others where due to the 
insufficient amount of places of turning down women can there be enough space 
and supply.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Government/ parliament of India</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This stakeholder is to help change and improve the cases in the states by 
helping introduce solutions that could cost or need to be accepted first by them 
before any change can occur</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits/added value </h2>
<p>Finding a solution in decreasing the tiniest number of crimes targeted to women in states/union 
territories that have a high severity level, can this help the female population in India feel safer.
If that is bringing awareness in a community or school, more security cameras or better laws 
regarding female rights, is it a step closer to a more secure environment for women. Every 
person regardless of their gender deserves the same rights. We live in a world together, where 
someone’s gender can give them more rights than another. Therefore, does this project not only 
strive for a safer environment for women but also gender equality and awareness/ change 
regarding these violent crimes targeted against women.</p>

<h2>The possible research question</h2>
<p>Due to the number of violent crimes committed against women in India over the past years, the 
research question is “Are there any factors that play a role in the rise and decrease in the 
amount of these crimes in India in specific states and if so, what are these factors that play a 
role and can they help predict the severity of states in India for women/girls?”.
With this question guiding the entire project, is the goal of this project clear and understandable 
to follow.</p>

<h2>Modeling</h2>
<p>After exploring the data in the second iteration do we know that to help predict the 
severity level of a state/union territory in India will a classification model be needed 
(Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor).
But before we can classify the severity of a state/union territory does our data need to 
be labeled which will K-means clustering algorithm be used to label our data.
To evaluate this model will the classification models mentioned above be used to see if 
the mean accuracy of the models is somewhat similar.</p>
